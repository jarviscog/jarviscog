## I'm currently working on


- 🧑‍🎓Studying abroad at City University of Hong Kong 🇭🇰
- 🌸Learning new languages like Rust and Component Pascal for CNC G-Code
- 🧹Polishing some old projects like [Bertha2](https://github.com/boyesm/Bertha2) and [autoanki](https://github.com/timmy6figures/autoanki)
- Completing cybersecurity challanges such as [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/)


## 💡Some of my most interesting projects💡

📝  [autoanki](https://github.com/timmy6figures/autoanki) is a tool to help create decks for Anki, a flashcard memorization tool. 

👨‍🏭  [enhanced-flashbang](https://github.com/timmy6figures/enhanced-flashbang) is a hardware addon for the video game CS:GO. Whenever a flashbang goes off in the game, a real life flash goes off in your face! 

🎹 [Bertha2](https://github.com/boyesm/Bertha2) is a self-playing piano that plays itself! Sometimes streaming on Twitch, enter a Youtube link in chat and it will attempt to play it!

📺 [NAND to Tetris](https://github.com/timmy6figures/nand-to-tetris) is a guided course where you build your own computer from the ground up, going from logic gates, to an ALU, to a compiler, to a Java-like high level language.

♟️ [Cota](https://github.com/timmy6figures/cota) is a board game that mixes elements from Chess, 象棋, Shogi, and Go. The game was created by a Vietnamese friend, and this is a virtual version that I used to learn the Rust language.

🌊 [openGLProjects](https://github.com/timmy6figures/openGLProjects) is a collection of assignments created during a computer graphics course taken at University. OpenGL was used during the course, and some interesting algorithms and techniques were used during the course, such as a marching cubes algorithm.
